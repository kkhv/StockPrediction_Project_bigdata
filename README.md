### Project goals 
* (1) Soving follw up problem(right shift) with LSTM model in stock prediction. This problem is relevent to information vanishing with LSTM
* (2) Making model that predict whether tomorrow stock' price will be increased or decreased

### Dataset
* Using dataset since 2000 in FAANG (FACEBOOK, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) dataset 
* I think it shows the stock data of IT companies growing in the stock market well.
